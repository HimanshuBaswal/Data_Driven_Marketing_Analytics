# Data_Driven_Marketing_Analytics

## Introduction
### Context
  You're a analyst and you've been told by the Chief Marketing Officer that recent marketing campaigns have not been as effective as they were expected to be. You need to analyze the data set to understand this problem and propose data-driven solutions.

[Note : The Context was taken from this Kaggle Dataset <p> https://www.kaggle.com/jackdaoud/marketing-data</p> So credits to the Task and Dataset provider. Thank You for sharing this project idea.]

### About the Data
This dataset was provided to students for their final projects in a course called Advanced Data Analytics as part of the Master of Science Business Analytics program at Hult International Business School for the AY 20/21. It can be utilized for EDA, Statistical Analysis, and Visualizations.

### Dataset Content
The is a CSV file of 2240 observations (customers) with 28 variables related to marketing data. More specifically, the variables provide insights about:

* Customer profiles
* Product preferences
* Campaign successes/failures
* Channel performance

## Tasks

### Section 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

* Are there any null values or outliers? How will you wrangle/handle them?
* Are there any variables that warrant transformations?
* Are there any useful variables that you can engineer with the given data?
* Do you notice any patterns or anomalies in the data? Can you plot them?

### Section 2: Statistical Analysis

Please run statistical tests in the form of regressions to answer these questions & propose data-driven action recommendations to your CMO. Make sure to interpret your results with non-statistical jargon so your CMO can understand your findings.

* What factors are significantly related to the number of store purchases?
* Does US fare significantly better than the Rest of the World in terms of total purchases?
* Your supervisor insists that people who buy gold are more conservative. Therefore, people who spent an above average amount on gold in the last 2 years would have more in store purchases. Justify or refute this statement using an appropriate statistical test.
* Fish has Omega 3 fatty acids which are good for the brain. Accordingly, do "Married PhD candidates" have a significant relation with amount spent on fish? What other factors are significantly related to amount spent on fish? (Hint: use your knowledge of interaction variables/effects)
